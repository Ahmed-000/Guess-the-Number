# Guess-the-Number
  How to Run This Game
  Copy the code: Take the provided Python script and paste it into a Python editor or an environment where you can run Python code, such as IDLE, PyCharm, or even an   online Python compiler.
  Execute the script: Run the script in your Python environment. The game will start immediately, asking you to guess a number.
  Play the game: Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your guesses. The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low, and you'll keep guessing until you    find the right number.
# Understanding the Code
Imports: The script starts by importing the random module, which is used to generate the random number.
Function Definition: The guess_the_number() function encapsulates the game logic.
Random Number Generation: number = random.randint(1, 100) generates a random number between 1 and 100.
Loop for Guessing: The while loop continues until the player guesses the correct number.
Input and Feedback: The script takes user input, checks it, and provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
Error Handling: There's a try-except block to handle cases where the input is not a valid integer.
Feel free to customize the game, perhaps by changing the range of numbers or adding features like a limit on the number of guesses. Have fun coding and playing!
